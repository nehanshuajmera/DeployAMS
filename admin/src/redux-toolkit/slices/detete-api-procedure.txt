here i will tell you how to call a delete api on frontend

import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux'; //these are hooks
import { include the api file having async in there name  dispatch the action using this } from '../../../redux-toolkit/slices/fetchdetailslice';  // include this file before dispatching action through this file
            const dispatch=useDispatch();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const unsub=async()=>{
      try{

        await dispatch(detetestudentasync("pass the id in string to delete"));

      }catch(error){
          console.log(error);
      }
    }
   
    unsub();
   }, [])
  
  const dataofstudent=useSelector((state)=>state.crudstudent);  // go to store and select the correct reducer name in this case we have crudstudent

  now you can fetch the data error message or anything you have to show on frontend;
  console.log(dataofstudent);
